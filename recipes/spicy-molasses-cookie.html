    <ul>
        <li>Cookie sheets</li>
        <li>Bowls, measuring cups and spoons (a scale is best)</li>
        <li>Stand mixer or electric mixer (not required but very helpful)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup 100g sugar <i>for rolling the cookies in</i></li>
        <li>2½ cups 315g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1½ tsp ground ginger</li>

        <li>1½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅓ cup 110g molasses <i>light or dark</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by mixing the sugar and butter together until it becomes creamy in texture. A stand mixer or hand mixer are great assets in this part, however not absolutely necessary.</li>
        <li>While doing step 1, in a separate bowl whisk together the flour with baking soda, all of the spices and the salt</li>
        <li>Once mixture is creamy, add the egg yolk, and beat until combined. Scrape down sides as needed</li>
        <li>Add in the vanilla and molasses and stir until completely incorporated</li>
        <li>Decrease mixer speed, and gradually add the flour mixture to the batter until fully combined</li>
        <li>Prepare 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, and put the 1/2 c sugar into a bowl</li>
        <li>Roll up each cookie, about 2 Tbsp of batter for each. into a ball and then toss each ball in the sugar. Put the cookie onto the cookie sheet and slightly flatten if desired</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies at 190C / 375F for approximately 10 to 12 minutes until the edges are just beginning to brown. Let sit on the sheet for 10 minutes before putting cookies on a wire rack to cool</li>
    </ol>
