    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>Easy and delicious red pepper soup that is the perfect side for any meal. It was inspired by a dish I learned in culinary school, however I have made some improvements, including creating a vegan alternative.</p>
    <p>While it isn't required, if you have a powerful blender, you may be able to make this soup even more easily. If not, there is no need to worry, any blender will do, it will just take an extra step. Lets get cooking shall we!</p>
    <h2>Equipment:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Blender or food processor</li>
            <li>Sieve (optional)</li>
            <li>Saucepan</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ea red peppers</li>
        <li>200ml coconut cream or 35% cream</li>
        <li>2.5 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Roughly chop the red peppers into roughly equal sized pieces. If using fresh lemons, now is the time to squeeze the lemon juice.</li>
        <li>If using coconut milk, drain off some of the excess liquid. Refrigerating beforehand would be helpful for this</li>
        <li>Method 1: Heat up cream and peppers in a pot, once cream has come to a boil, lower heat to medium and allow to cook for 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>After 5 minutes transfer peppers and cream to a blender or food processor, pulse until well blended. (Skip next step)</li>
        <li>Method 2: If using a blender that has the ability to heat the soup, this is where you begin. Prepare the peppers and cream as stated in step 1. Put the cream and then the peppers into the blender. If your blender has a soup preset use this, if not, use the highest setting for 6 minutes. </li>
        <li>Once the hot soup is blended, strain through a sieve to get a nice smooth texture</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice and salt, taste and adjust the seasonings to your liking. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Recipe notes:</h2>
