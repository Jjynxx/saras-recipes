# saras-recipes
Introduction 

I am very new to learning web development. This project is a recipe website that I will be creating under the guidance of the Odin Project. This project is to help learn the skills used to create a basic homepage that will navigate to a few recipes. 

This project will help to develop HTML skills, to start with. More will come down the line.
